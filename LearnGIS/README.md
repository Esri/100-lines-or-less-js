LearnGIS
===========

A simple tour example on how to guide your users at using your app and learning the basic GIS concepts on it.

The main concepts here are:
* how to attach the tour to some dynamic content created by Esri's Javascript API;
* create an interactive tutorial waiting for user interaction to continue.

Try it out [here](http://esri.github.io/100-lines-or-less-js/LearnGIS/)!

Possible improvements:
* Save tour state across user sections/interactions;
* Create different tours based on user goal or role;

This application has used the context [demo application](https://esri.github.io/100-lines-or-less-js/basemaptour) as the GIS application.
