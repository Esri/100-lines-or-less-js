Geo Crowd Mapping
=================

Geo Crowd Mapping is a collaborative web app where you can make your edits (red) and see other people's edits (blue) in real time. 

Use Layer Swipe widget for distraction-free-mode and/or to compare your edits with other users.

Use trash can button to delete your edits in the current session.

Have fun!

Cheers!!!!
