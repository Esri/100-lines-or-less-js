Beam-me-up-Scotty
===========

Capt'n Kirk would be a huge Instagram fan. :)

Instructions: Click anywhere on the map to show available images in the radius (green circle)... or ask Scotty to beam you somewhere else by clicking on blue `Beam Me Up` button :). Also you can see in the realtime where other people are clicking on the map (red circles).

Use `Hard Reset` button to delete complete "beaming" history and all users will instantly see the changes... thanks firebase.io :).

Each time you click on the map `Beam Me Up` button will show you the number of the results returned by the Instagram. Likewise, `Hard Reset` button will show you the total number of the results for all the users currently using the app.

Cheers!!!
