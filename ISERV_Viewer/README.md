ISERV Viewer
===========

The ISS SERVIR Environmental Research and Visualization System (ISERV) automatically takes images of Earth through a small telescope with an off-the-shelf digital camera mounted in the International Space Station’s Destiny module. When ISERV is running, it captures 3 images per second that cover approximately a 19 km x 11 km area each. The goal is to improve automatic image capturing and data transfer, but the images taken in the experiment could also help environmental scientists, disaster responders and other Earth-based users.  This ISERV Viewer makes it possible for everyone to view and share the best images available from ISERV as well as see the current location of the ISS.

Instructions: Tap an ISERV icon to zoom to the image location.  You can adjust the opacity with the slider at the top of your browser.  If you are on a mobile device You may shake to zoom out to full extent or swipe the bottom swipe bar to navigate to the next image.  If you are not on a mobile device you should see a world icon at the top and can click that to zoom back out to full extent.

Check out where the ISS is, enjoy the cool images from space, and share them with your friends!
